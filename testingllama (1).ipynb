       "\"(Jan 30, 2020  7:00 PM) Fred Silverman, who steered programming for each of the Big Three broadcast networks and brought All in the Family, Roots, Hawaii Five-O and other hit series and miniseries to television, died Thursday. He was 82. Silverman, who had been battling cancer, died at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, the AP reports. Silverman's gift for picking winners prompted Time magazine to dub him  The Man with the Golden Gut  in a 1977 profile. As ABC's entertainment chief, Silverman turned the network’s fortunes around with shows including Roots, Rich Man, Poor Man and Charlie’s Angels. He had already brought success to CBS with an overhaul that included replacing country-themed series such as Green Acres with what advertisers considered more upscale and urban fare, including The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Bob Newhart Show and Mannix. He couldn't repeat that success when he moved to NBC.\""
